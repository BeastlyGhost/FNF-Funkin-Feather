# Prerequisites:
Once again, PLEASE ensure that the feature you are requesting will benefit Funkin': Feather as a whole, not just a specific mod.

# Information:
BEFORE requesting any features, keep in mind that said feature should benefit Funkin': Feather itself, if said requirement isn't met, then the feature request will *automatically* be disregarded. 

**Features that are mod oriented will not be approved.**

**Features that are for the sole benefit of the person requesting them will also not be approved.**

Features should generally benefit everyone, and suggestions will very rarely be taken unless they are critical to maintaining Funkin': Feather. 

Thank you.
