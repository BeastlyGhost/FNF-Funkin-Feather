# Funkin': Feather

![repo-size](https://img.shields.io/github/repo-size/BeastlyGhost/FNF-Funkin-Feather)

A rewrite of [Friday Night Funkin'](https://github.com/ninjamuffin99/Funkin).

**Note: Funkin': Feather, in its current state, is not ready for mod use and is unfinished**.

---
Made for learning purposes and as a love letter for Friday Night Funkin's modding community.
While still being very early in development, feedback and help with this project is appreciated.

The base game won't be included with Funkin': Feather, as it's made specifically for mods and mods *only*.
However, it will be distributed separately, like a mod in it of itself.

## How to build?
-- in this section, "terminal / Command prompt or powershell" will be reffered as "Console"
1. Install Haxe
2. Install the hmm library (Type ``haxelib install hmm`` in your Console)
3. Open the console in the engine folder and type ``haxelib run hmm install``. This command will install all libraries from within the `hmm.json` file, which are needed as depedencies for the engine.
4. Type ``lime build [target platform (windows, linux, html5, etc)]``
