A Work in Progress rewrite of [Friday Night Funkin'](https://github.com/ninjamuffin99/Funkin).

---
Made for learning purposes and as a love letter for Friday Night Funkin's modding community.
While still being very early in development, feedback and help with this project is appreciated.

The base game won't be included with Funkin': Feather, as it's made specifically for mods and mods *only*.
However, it will be distributed separately, like a mod in it of itself.

**FUNKIN' FEATHER IS NOT REALLY READY FOR MOD USE YET, IT IS STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS AND VERY UNFINISHED**

**IF YOU WISH TO HELP DEVELOPMENT GO FASTER, FEEL FREE TO DO SO ON A [PULL REQUEST](https://github.com/BeastlyGhost/FNF-Funkin-Feather/pulls)**

## How to build?
-- in this section, "terminal / Command prompt or powershell" will be reffered as "Console"
1. Install Haxe
2. Install the hmm library (Type ``haxelib install hmm`` in your Console)
3. Open the console in the engine folder and type ``haxelib run hmm install``. This command will install all libraries from within the `hmm.json` file, which are needed as depedencies for the engine.
4. Type ``lime build [target platform (windows, linux, html5, etc)]``

You can do so on either [Twitter](https://twitter.com/BeastlyGabi) or [Discord](https://discord.com/users/597124141530742805), you can also [open an issue](https://github.com/BeastlyGhost/FNF-Funkin-Feather/issues), as that would give me the same level of contact that these other platforms do.
