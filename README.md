---
Made for learning purposes and as a love letter for Friday Night Funkin's modding community.
While still being very early in development, feedback and help with this project is appreciated.

The base game won't be included with Funkin': Feather, as it's made specifically for mods and mods *only*.
However, it will be distributed separately, like a mod in it of itself.

**FUNKIN' FEATHER IS NOT REALLY READY FOR MOD USE YET, IT IS STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS AND VERY UNFINISHED**

**IF YOU WISH TO HELP DEVELOPMENT GO FASTER, FEEL FREE TO DO SO ON A [PULL REQUEST](https://github.com/BeastlyGhost/FNF-Funkin-Feather/pulls)**
